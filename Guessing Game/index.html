		<p class="p">This game is all about guessing a number. The program will come up with a random number between 0 and 100. Your goal as the player is to find this number. You will get 5 guesses, and will be told if the number is higher or lower than your guess. Once you click the guess button on the 6th button press it will just give you the answer. On the right you can see that you have an input box to place your number, a restart button to start the program over, and a guess button to check if your guess is correct. Now, can you guess the number.</p></div>
