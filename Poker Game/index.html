		//This is a program that simulates a normal game of Poker. There is an array that stores all the cards used and ensures that no card is used twice when producing random numbers from the drawnCard variable.
		/*These are all the variables used throughout the program each dealing with production of cards in some way*/
		let cards = [];//this is the array that keeps track of the cards used
		let drawnCard = null;//this is a variable used to produce random cards later in the program
		const finder = -1;//this is a constant variable that checks to see if the value of drawnCard is not inside the cards array
		let cardPos = 0;//this is a variable used for displaying 10 cards and stopping the deal button
		let converter = null;//this is a variable that is used for converting cardPos into a string inorder to use for the ids of the pictures and array element position

		function deal()//This is the deal button function that starts the program off
		{
			if(cardPos == 0 || cardPos == 10)//this is an if statement that checks the value of cardPos using an or operator that only allows the button to work at the start and end of the program
			{
				//all these document.getElementById commands reset all the cards to be blank for the start of a new game when the button is pressed
				document.getElementById("0").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("1").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("2").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("3").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("4").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("5").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("6").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("7").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("8").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				document.getElementById("9").src = "images/blank.jpg";
				cardPos = 0;//sets the value of cardPos to 0 for the start of a new game because the value will always end at 10 and needs to reset
				cards =[];//sets the cards array to be empty for a new game to be played
				timer();//function call to the timer function
			}
		}
		function timer()//function that controls the time between each cards placement
		{
			setTimeout(draw, 500);//Timer function that calls the draw function after half a second to then place a new card
		}

		function draw()//function that controls the drawing of new cards and the placement of cards
		{
			if(cardPos != 10)//if statement that stops new cards from being created when cardPos is equal to ten.
			{
				drawnCard = Math.floor(Math.random() * 52) + 1;//the drawnCard variable is grabbing a random number between 1 and 52
				if(cards.indexOf(drawnCard) == finder)//if statement checks to see if the drawnCard's value is not inside of the cards array. finder is equal to -1 which is the value returned if the indexOf function can't find the value
				{
					cards.push(drawnCard);//adds the drawnCard value into the array
					converter = cardPos.toString()//the converter variable takes the value of cardPos and makes it into a string so that converter can used for the id of the images and the index of the element for the card array
					document.getElementById(converter).src = "images/" + cards[converter] + ".jpg";//document.getElementById is displaying the new card that was added to the cards array. Each card is named as a value between 1 and 52. Converter is used for the id as each id a number 0-9 and the cards array will only contain 10 values 0-9 for the cards. 
					cardPos++;/*cardPos is incrementing each time as converter needs it to change the next card, the button needs it to be 0 or 10, and the first if statement in this function needs it to be 10 to stop card production*/
					timer();//function call that recalls the timer to start the process again
				}
				else//else statment that runs if the drawnCard value is already inside of the cards array
				{
					draw();//function call that recalls the draw function
				}
